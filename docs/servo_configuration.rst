Servo Configuration
===================

Since the servos used in this kit are adjusted by software and there's
no such physical sticking point as other servos, here we need to
configure the servo via software. First you need to finish some software
installation before the configuration.

.. note::
    Please do forget to put in the battery and slide the power switch to ON in following chapters.

Get Source Code
---------------

You can find the source code in our Github repositories. Download the
source code by *git clone*:

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/
    git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_PiCar-S.git -b V3.0

.. note::
    Please pay attention to your typing – if you get the prompt of
    entering your user name and password, you may have typed wrong. If
    unluckily you did so, press Ctrl + C to exit and try again.


Go to the Code Directory
------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    cd ~/SunFounder_PiCar-S/
    ls

Enter the code directory and you can see the installation script:

.. image:: media/image90.png


Install the Environment via Script 
----------------------------------

You can get all the required software and configuration done with the
installation script. If you want to do step by step instead, refer to
the operations in **Appendix 1: Installing Manually**.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    sudo ./install_dependencies

.. note::

   1. The installation script will install the required components and
      configure for the running environment. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is
      connected to the Internet during the installation, or it would fail.

   2. The Raspberry Pi will prompt you to reboot after the installation.
      You're recommended to type in **yes** to reboot.

Set the Servo to 90 Degrees
---------------------------

After reboot, type in the command:

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    picar

You can see three commands here.

.. image:: media/image91.png


The first one **servo-install** is for **servo adjustment**, which is
used after the front wheels are assembled. The servo will rotate to 90
degrees after this command is run, so we will use this command here.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    picar servo-install

.. image:: media/image92.png


.. note::
    If the "OSError: [Errno 121] Remote I/O error" error message appears,
    open raspi-config:

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>
 
.. code-block::

    sudo raspi-config


Then choose **3 Interfacing Options** → **P5 I2C** → **<YES>** →\ **OK**
to enable I2C service. You can use the up, down, left, and right keys on
the keyboard to select, and then press Enter to confirm.

After the code is running, insert the rocker arm into the servo. You
will see the rocker arm is rotate in clockwise and counterclockwise,
then stop at a specific location. It means the servo is good. If the any
of the conditions below happened to your servo, your servo is bad:

1) Noisy, hot.

2) If unplug the servo line and rotate the rocker arm, it sounds like
   “ka” “ka” “ka” or there has no sounds of gear driving.

3) Rotate slowly but continuously.

If you find one of the conditions above, please send e-mail to
`service@sunfounder.com <mailto:support@sunfounder.com>`__ . We will
change a new one to you. If it is broken in the process of using or
assembling, you should go to the official website
`www.sunfounder.com <http://www.sunfounder.com>`__ to buy.

Build the Rest of the Car
-------------------------

.. warning::
    Please keep the command **servo-install** running in the whole process of assembly.

Mount the steering servo to the Upper Plate with two **M2x8 Screws** and
two **M2 nuts** (pay attention to the direction of the servo wires):

.. image:: media/image94.png


The **Rocker Arm** is facing straight ahead, and then inserted into the
Servo shaft, and then fixed with **Rocker Arm Fixing Screw** (the
shortest).

Mount the wheels onto the Upper Plate carefully.

.. image:: media/image230.png


Then put the assembled Front Half Chassis onto the Upper Plate with
standoffs aligned with the holes.

.. image:: media/image97.png


Hold them carefully, turn upside down, and fasten the standoffs and the
Upper Plate with four **M3x8 screws**:

**So now, the whole assembly is DONE! Congratulations!**
